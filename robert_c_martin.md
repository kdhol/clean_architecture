The document is an overview of "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin, focusing on software design principles, programming paradigms, and best practices for software development.

# Chapter 17 â€“ Boundaries: Drawing Lines

## Purpose
Define clear architectural boundaries to isolate changes, enable testability, and preserve the independence of core business logic.

## Key Concepts
- **Boundary Definition**: Separate the system into layers with clear responsibilities (e.g., UI, Use Cases, Entities).
- **Dependency Rule**: Inner layers should not depend on outer layers.
- **Use Interfaces**: Communicate across boundaries using abstract interfaces.
- **Flexibility Through Isolation**: Swap out UI or DB layers without touching core logic.

## Takeaways
- Protect business rules from volatile external concerns.
- Follow Dependency Inversion to decouple core from frameworks.
- Boundaries are the foundation of Clean Architecture.
